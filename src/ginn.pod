=head1 NAME

ginn - Gesture to Keypress / Mouse Button injector

=head1 SYNOPSIS

ginn [<specific configuration file>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<ginn> is a program to test support gestures in legacy applications without the
need to rewrite them.  This support is made by injecting keypresses or mouse
buttons after matching rules from wishes.xml file.

You can define the matching rules by expressing I<wishes>. Each wish contains
the name of the gesture, number of fingers, the matching rules.
The keypress to inject is defined by I<key> tag, and the mouse button by
I<button>, you can add also up to 4 modifiers keys like I<Control_L>.


=head2 EXAMPLES

Sample wishes file:

    <ginn>
    <global>
      <wish gesture="Drag" fingers="2">
        <action name="action5" when="update">
          <trigger prop="delta y" min="20" max="80"/>
          <key>Down</key>
        </action>
      </wish>
    </global>
    <applications>
      <application name="inkscape">
        <wish gesture="Pinch" fingers="2">
          <action name="action1" when="update">
            <trigger prop="radius delta" min="-200" max="-40"/>
            <key>KP_Subtract</key>
          </action>
        </wish>
      </application>
    </applications>
    </ginn>


Gesture type can be: Drag, Pinch, Rotate or Tap
The time of injection can be selected by using I<update> to inject when the
gesture is received or I<finish> to inject when the gesture is finished.
The choice should be written inside the I<when> in the action line.
        <action name="action1" when="update">

The Open Input Framework gesture stack provide gesture updates which can be very small to
reach the desired interval specified in the trigger.
To provide more flexibility a gesture accumulation is performed by default to
the successive property values' updates for a desired gesture until it reaches
the min-max intervall or the gesture finish, then, the accumlation buffer is
reinitialized.
If you want to disable this feature you can specify it explicitly:
        <trigger prop="delta x" min="-80" max="-40" accumulate="false"/>

The attributes used in trigger can be obtained by running geistest, you can 
also refer to the list below.
You can use more than one trigger, but you need to use them in the same order
as they appear in the list below.

    Sub-list of general attributes
     "device id"       = 13
     "timestamp"       = 180598198
     "root window id"  = 254
     "event window id" = 159825921
     "child window id" = 159825921
     "focus x"         = 0.000000
     "focus y"         = 0.000000
     "gesture name"    = "Drag"
     "touches"         = 1
      
    Sub-list of attributes used with Drag gesture
     "delta x"    = -8.933333 
     "delta y"    = 22.000000
     "velocity x" = -0.638095
     "velocity y" = 1.571429
     "position x" = 634.533386
     "position y" = 482.777771

    Sub-list of attributes used with Rotate gesture
     "angle delta"      = -0.358113 
     "angular velocity" = -0.029843
     "angle"            = -1.159999
     
    Sub-list of attributes used with Pinch gesture
     "radius delta"    = -44.935688
     "radial velocity" = -3.209692
     "radius"          = 180.466690
     
    Sub-list of attributes used with Tap gesture
     "tap time"   = 74.000000 
     "position x" = 740.933350
     "position y" = 469.333344
     
    Last attribues in the general list
     "boundingbox x1" = 634.533386
     "boundingbox y1" = 482.777771
     "boundingbox x2" = 634.533386
     "boundingbox y2" = 482.777771
     "touch 0 id"     = 1079.000000
     "touch 0 x"      = 634.533386
     "touch 0 y"      = 482.777771


The names of keys list can be obtained after removing the XK_ prefix from
/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h file

 The mouse buttons are written with their corresponding number:
    1   Left Button
    2   Middle Button
    3   Right Button
    4   Wheel Up
    5   Wheel Down
    6   Horizontal Wheel Left
    7   Horizontal Wheel Right
    8   "Back" in browsers
