This is a testing code to validate the idea behind Ginn (now is pure hacks).
It is based on utouch-gesturetest code made by Chase Douglas for Canonical.

A complete rewrite will follow next days to make the matching between gesture and targetted application more dynamic and easily configurable via a daemon.

To test the current code, you just need to run the executable file with the mask 0xf8: gesturetest 0 0 0xf8

Please stay tuned to the upcoming code change.
